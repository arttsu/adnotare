# Adnotare

Adnotare is a desktop tool for improving collaboration with LLMs.

Paste an LLM response (or any text), highlight specific passages,
attach a predefined prompt (with an optional note) to each selection,
and copy annotations as structured text.

Instead of manually describing context, you reference exact spans of
text -- so follow-up prompts are clearer and faster to write.
